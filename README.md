# Pallet Portal

Pallet Portal is a dual-archway automated pallet scanning system designed to streamline outbound shipping operations by integrating barcode detection, object tracking, and manifest verification. It leverages the **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano**, custom 3D-printed hardware, and a Python-based graphical interface.

## Overview
- Dual IMX219 cameras for live barcode capture and object tracking.  
- Integrated IR barcode scanner for redundancy and precision.  
- Ultrasonic ping sensors for pallet presence detection and GUI activation.  
- Custom PyQt GUI for real-time feedback, mode selection, and system status.  
- Fully 3D-printed button interface and display housing, mounted on a dual-arch frame.

## Features
✅ Live dual-camera video feed via GStreamer pipeline.  
✅ Barcode detection and comparison using Pillow / Pyzbar / ZXing.  
✅ Ultrasonic sensor input synchronized with GUI states to prevent crosstalk.  
✅ Automatic USB manifest detection and reading.  
✅ Hardware input mapped to GUI navigation (Down, Cancel, Select, Up).  
✅ Custom layered button icons designed in Fusion 360 for tactile control.  

## Hardware
- Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit  
- Dual IMX219 Cameras  
- Ultrasonic Ping Sensors (HC-SR04)  
- IR Barcode Scanner  
- 3D-Printed Components: Display enclosure, button case, dual-layer buttons, scaled pallet model (203 mm width)

## Software Stack
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Python 3 | Main control and GUI logic |
| PyQt5 / Pillow | GUI display and image processing |
| GStreamer | Real-time camera pipeline |
| pyzbar / ZXing | Barcode decoding (OpenCV-free alternatives) |
| GPIO / Jetson.GPIO | Peripheral communication |
| Threading | Dual-camera and sensor concurrency management |

## Current Focus
- Refining UI housing and crossmember mounting.  
- Transitioning from YOLO to Pillow-based lightweight detection.  
- Optimizing IR-scanner and camera coordination to prevent redundant reads.  
- Improving print efficiency for long 3D jobs (>10 hours per iteration).  

## Known Issues
- Occasional PyQt layout and event conflicts.  
- Camera sensor-ID mismatches between CAM0 and CAM1.  
- nvargus-daemon instability under high-load capture.  
- Jetson thermal throttling during extended use.  
- 3D print size limitations requiring segmented builds.
